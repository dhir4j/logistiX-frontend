## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#72BCD4) for a professional and trustworthy feel, mirroring the reliability of courier services.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7) to provide a clean and modern backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted orange (#FFAB91) used for interactive elements to draw attention without being intrusive.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a clean, geometric, modern, and readable header.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, providing a slightly warmer, friendly, and easily readable counterpoint to 'Poppins'.
- Use vector-based icons to maintain a consistent and scalable visual style across the application. The style will have a modern look with a professional aesthetic. Icons should intuitively represent the various functionalities of the app such as tracking, booking, and pricing.
- Design layout with soft shadows and rounded cards for a user-friendly and modern look, inspired by Wonderpay. Ensure a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to both mobile and desktop environments. Use a grid-based layout for content organization and a clean, intuitive navigation system.
